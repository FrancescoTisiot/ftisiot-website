      <description>Las week I shared a personal experience of talking to a small online audience (just one person) and how that episode made me think about my commitment to public talking and understanding that performing at best is still key for both the speaker and the audience.&#xA;One of the items that I explored was the Reflection bit: trying to understand what/why the paper/abstract didn&amp;rsquo;t work, why it didn&amp;rsquo;t attract people and what can be done to improve it.</description>
