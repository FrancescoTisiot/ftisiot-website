      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve had this small personal website for some time now, adding from time to time some stuff mainly related to Oracle Analytics, the Italian Oracle User Group and personal speaking experiences.
I was running it on Wordpress.com which was providing a nice completely managed experience: I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to care about hosting, versioning, SSL etc, all was managed by the platform. I just had to focus on content writing and on top of it I had, out of the box, nice dashboards showing visitors of the page and other blog stats.</description>
