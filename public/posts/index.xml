      <title>What&#39;s My (Talk) Age Again?</title>

      <description>Las week I shared a personal experience of talking to a small online audience (just one person) and how that episode made me think about my commitment to public talking and understanding that performing at best is still key for both the speaker and the audience.
One of the items that I explored was the Reflection bit: trying to understand what/why the paper/abstract didn&amp;rsquo;t work, why it didn&amp;rsquo;t attract people and what can be done to improve it.</description>

      <title>A Talk For One</title>

      <description>2020 hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a great year, with Covid forcing people home and all major events moving from physical to virtual. At the same time, now is the perfect time for attendees: everyone is creating and sharing content via videos, blogs or talks in conferences. People that before had to choose wisely the &amp;ldquo;1 conference&amp;rdquo; where to spend their budget on, now can access for free (or reduced fees) content coming from a huge variety of organisations and speakers.</description>

      <link>https://ftisiot.net/2020/09/18/oracle-analytics-server-and-kerberos-authentication/</link>

      <guid>https://ftisiot.net/2020/09/18/oracle-analytics-server-and-kerberos-authentication/</guid>
      <description>Oracle Analytics Server is out since several months and a common ask is to provide SSO with Kerberos Authentication.
The &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; OBIEE12c style Kerberos configuration is not working with OAS.
Oracle provided a solution to implement it via Apache Server and Oracle Access Manager Identity Asserter. All the info are published in Doc ID 2707401.1</description>

      <description>The 2019 end-of-year holiday period is approaching, before closing the laptop for few days it&amp;rsquo;s good to look back how the year went. It has been very busy working wise: client work, conference preparation and talks, blog posts and videos kept my time well occupied. I also had an amazing news in June, when, during Kscope 19, I was invited on the stage and announced as Oracle ACE Director

      <description>If you read this now and you wanted to submit for ITOUG Tech Days 2020&amp;hellip;. well, bad luck, you&amp;rsquo;re too late! ITOUG Tech Days 2020 was closed last week with an astonishing record of submissions! This post will analyse a bit the numbers of the submissions using the magic Oracle Analytics Cloud.
First of all, uploading the data and fixing the column settings. For example, we want to properly convert to Date our Submission Date (Data di invio in Italian).</description>

      <description>Hello! After a long time I&amp;rsquo;m back to my personal blog! You can find all my Rittman Mead related blog posts here!
Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some personal study around various areas including streaming, machine learning and data visualization and one of the tools that got my attention is Looker. I&amp;rsquo;ve initially heard about Looker from a Drill to Detail podcast from Mark Rittman and increasingly been hearing about it in conferences and use cases together with other cloud solutions like BigQuery, Snowflake and Fivetran.</description>

      <title>OBI12c SSL with Custom Certificates</title>
      <link>https://ftisiot.net/2016/10/16/obi12c-ssl-with-custom-certificates/</link>

      <guid>https://ftisiot.net/2016/10/16/obi12c-ssl-with-custom-certificates/</guid>
      <description>For anybody on OBIEE 12c wanting to enable full SSL, Oracle provided within the OBIEE Documentation an explanation on how to set it up using demo certificates.
However the usage of demo certificates gives the end user the annoying problem of needing to accept an exception to enter the website since the demo certificate wasn&amp;rsquo;t created for the server/domain where OBIEE is located (the same problem arises also with Smartview).</description>

      <title>Remove OBI12c Data Visualisation from OBIEE</title>
      <link>https://ftisiot.net/2016/10/13/remove-obi12c-data-visualisation-from-obiee/</link>

      <guid>https://ftisiot.net/2016/10/13/remove-obi12c-data-visualisation-from-obiee/</guid>
      <description>For anybody interested in how to remove or add Data Visualisation (also known as Visual Analyser) option to a specific role in OBIEE 12c, Oracle released Doc ID 2102444.1 which gives the detail about the procedure using WLST and the RevokeDVPermission.py (or GrantDVPermission.py) that should be present in the OBIEE12c Installation Middleware home by default.</description>

      <title>How to search the Cause of Errors</title>
      <link>https://ftisiot.net/2016/10/12/how-to-search-the-cause-of-errors/</link>

      <guid>https://ftisiot.net/2016/10/12/how-to-search-the-cause-of-errors/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on OBIEE and Oracle products in general since 2008, it has been so far a great experience with an enormous amount of information being available freely in internet.
When trying to solve problems this amount of information can be a treasure but also a risk since the information contained in any website can be partial, not relevant or in some cases completely wrong for the subject searched. As an unexperienced person (but also for experienced) it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to distinguish whether the content of a website can be followed and trusted and sometimes even replies to public forums can&amp;rsquo;t be a valid source since different problems provide the similar wrong behaviour and can be confused.</description>

      <description>Hi All,
If you already migrated to OBI12c you could experience, when printing to PDF a dashboard or analysis including performance tiles that the layout is not what expected.
