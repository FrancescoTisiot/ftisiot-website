      <description>&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I wrote a piece on solving &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunnar-morling-2b44b7229/&#34;&gt;Gunnar Morling&lt;/a&gt; interesting &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/&#34;&gt;1 billion rows challenge&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://ftisiot.net/posts/1brows&#34;&gt;PostgreSQL and ClickHouse&lt;/a&gt;. Since &lt;a href=&#34;http://aiven.io&#34;&gt;Aiven&lt;/a&gt; provides also MySQL, I wanted to give it a try. TLDR; The results are much slower than PG and ClickHouse, do you have any suggestion on how to improve?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last week the good old &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/gunnar-morling-2b44b7229/&#34;&gt;Gunnar Morling&lt;/a&gt; launched an interesting &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.morling.dev/blog/one-billion-row-challenge/&#34;&gt;challenge&lt;/a&gt; about ordering 1 billion rows in Java. Like my ex colleague and friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinmoffatt/&#34;&gt;Robin Moffat&lt;/a&gt;, I&amp;rsquo;m not at all a Java expert, and while &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmoff.net/2024/01/03/1%EF%B8%8F%E2%83%A3%EF%B8%8F-1brc-in-sql-with-duckdb/&#34;&gt;Robin used DuckDB&lt;/a&gt; to solve the challenge, I did the same with PostgreSQL and ClickHouse.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Pros and Cons of Multi Step Data Platforms</title>
      <link>https://ftisiot.net/posts/pros-and-cons-of-multi-step-data-platforms/</link>

      <guid>https://ftisiot.net/posts/pros-and-cons-of-multi-step-data-platforms/</guid>
      <description>In the modern world, it&amp;rsquo;s rare to have the data in the same shape and platform from the beginning till the end of its journey. Yes, some technologies can achieve quite a good range of functionalities but sometimes at the expense of precision, developer experience or performance. Therefore, to achieve better or faster results, people might select a new tool for a precise task and start an implementation and integration process to move the data around.</description>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Soâ€¦ what does a Staff Developer Advocate do, and how is it different from the Senior Developer Advocate role you were doing before?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I got this question three times in the last two weeks after my promotion from Senior to Staff (ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰), from various people in my network.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ftisiot.net/posts/tech-scalability/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Technical scalability is one of the main drivers of a data platform, as mentioned in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://aiven.io/blog/a-soft-methodology-to-define-robust-data-platforms&#34;&gt;SOFT methodology&lt;/a&gt;. But what are the options? In this blog we&amp;rsquo;ll evaluate the direction of scalability and the tradeoffs you might encounter in the decision process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>From data stack to data stuck: the risks of not asking the right data questions</title>
      <link>https://ftisiot.net/posts/from-data-stack-to-data-stuck/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Companies are in a continuous motion: new requirements, new data streams, new technologies are popping up every day. When designing new data platforms supporting the needs of your company, failing to perform a complete assessment of the options available can have disastrous effects on a company&amp;rsquo;s capability to innovate, and making sure their data assets usable and reusable in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I started following the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.softwareandbooz.com/pgsql-phriday-001-invite/&#34;&gt;#PGSQLPhriday&lt;/a&gt; initiative a couple months back but never had the time to properly sit down and write due to conference traveling. Therefore I was super happy to be at home this week and find out that &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlasylum.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/pgsql-phriday-003-what-is-the-community-to-you/&#34;&gt;PGSQL Phriday #003 theme&lt;/a&gt; is about the PostgreSQL community!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://ftisiot.net/posts/apache-flink-to-timestamp-ltz/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes when defining an Apache FlinkÂ® table using SQL we need to map an &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time&#34;&gt;epoch timestamp&lt;/a&gt; and use it as record/message timestamp, this blog contains few tricks to get it right.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time someone talks about slides design a great debate is generated. People have opinions and, guess what? Specifically in the area of public speaking, they seem to be quite vocal about them ðŸ¤£.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>It was February 2012 when I was meant to take a flight from a foggy Treviso Airport direction London Stansted. The fog created several problems, all passengers were taken by bus to Venice and we had to wait 3 hours before boarding on the plane. The flight ðŸ›¬ landed with an overall 4h of delay, not great if the scheduled arrival time was 8PM! I then caught a bus to Liverpool street and finally got lost while trying to reach my hotel.</description>

      <description>Las week I shared a personal experience of talking to a small online audience (just one person) and how that episode made me think about my commitment to public talking and understanding that performing at best is still key for both the speaker and the audience.&#xA;One of the items that I explored was the Reflection bit: trying to understand what/why the paper/abstract didn&amp;rsquo;t work, why it didn&amp;rsquo;t attract people and what can be done to improve it.</description>

      <description>2020 hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a great year, with Covid forcing people home and all major events moving from physical to virtual. At the same time, now is the perfect time for attendees: everyone is creating and sharing content via videos, blogs or talks in conferences. People that before had to choose wisely the &amp;ldquo;1 conference&amp;rdquo; where to spend their budget on, now can access for free (or reduced fees) content coming from a huge variety of organisations and speakers.</description>

You can find all my Rittman Mead related blog posts here!&#xA;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some personal study around various areas including streaming, machine learning and data visualization and one of the tools that got my attention is Looker. I&amp;rsquo;ve initially heard about Looker from a Drill to Detail podcast from Mark Rittman and increasingly been hearing about it in conferences and use cases together with other cloud solutions like BigQuery, Snowflake and Fivetran.</description>

      <description>For anybody on OBIEE 12c wanting to enable full SSL, Oracle provided within the OBIEE Documentation an explanation on how to set it up using demo certificates.&#xA;However the usage of demo certificates gives the end user the annoying problem of needing to accept an exception to enter the website since the demo certificate wasn&amp;rsquo;t created for the server/domain where OBIEE is located (the same problem arises also with Smartview).</description>

      <description>For anybody interested in how to remove or add Data Visualisation (also known as Visual Analyser) option to a specific role in OBIEE 12c, Oracle released Doc ID 2102444.1 which gives the detail about the procedure using WLST and the RevokeDVPermission.py (or GrantDVPermission.py) that should be present in the OBIEE12c Installation Middleware home by default.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on OBIEE and Oracle products in general since 2008, it has been so far a great experience with an enormous amount of information being available freely in internet.&#xA;When trying to solve problems this amount of information can be a treasure but also a risk since the information contained in any website can be partial, not relevant or in some cases completely wrong for the subject searched. As an unexperienced person (but also for experienced) it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to distinguish whether the content of a website can be followed and trusted and sometimes even replies to public forums can&amp;rsquo;t be a valid source since different problems provide the similar wrong behaviour and can be confused.</description>
