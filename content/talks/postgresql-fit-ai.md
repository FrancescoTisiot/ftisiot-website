description: "PostgreSQL may not be the first thing that comes to mind when we think about AI, but it's becoming increasingly important for a growing number of users. In this talk, we'll take a look at the current state of AI and explain why PostgreSQL has a potential to play a key role in it.

We'll start by exploring workflows and architectures, from the traditional Machine Learning approach of training and forecasting to the modern Generative AI techniques of fine-tuning and prompt engineering. In this step, we'll show how PostgreSQL can serve as a data source.

Moving forward, you’ll see how feeding the AI pipeline back to PostgreSQL can lead to accurate and consistent inference. Finally we'll look into how AI can help PostgreSQL users improve performance pattern discovery, optimize indexing, and suggest query optimizations.

As AI continues to become a bigger part of every company, this session will help you to make sure PostgreSQL and your implementations remain relevant on this journey."

Why PostgreSQL matters in the AI space as source, central component and target.
