## Abstract

How do we answer questions about GDPR, data lineage, impact assessment, security scans with a SQL query? If all data assets are in PostgreSQL®, well... problem solved! We can hit the metadata views and extract what's needed. But what happens when data is scattered across several platforms using different technologies?

This talk is about the hidden treasure stored in the metadata: starting by defining use cases, we'll then focus on how we can design a system, based on PostgreSQL and some graph theory, that collects, merges and exposes metadata coming from a variety of tools.

If you want to programmatically keep control over your ever increasing data assets using a familiar technology and SQL, this session is for you!
