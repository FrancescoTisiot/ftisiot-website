## Abstract

GDPR, data lineage, impact assessment, security scans are only few situations where a proper metadata handling can turn a month long project into a simple query.
The talk is about the hidden gold stored in metadata: starting by defining use cases, we'll then focus on point solutions making metadata accessible for a precise technology. But companies data efforts are rarely limited to a single tech, therefore we'll discuss how to design a system that collects, merges are makes available metadata coming from different tools.

Finally we'll show an Open Source tool, the Aiven metadata parser, that can help harvesting and querying the metadata from a variety of different Open Source technologies.

If you want to programmatically keep control over your dynamic data assets, this session is for you!
