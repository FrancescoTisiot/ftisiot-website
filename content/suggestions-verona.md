## Gelato
My preference in the city center are: 

* [The art of ice cream](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187871-d6555166-Reviews-L_Arte_del_Gelato-Verona_Province_of_Verona_Veneto.html)

* [Pecora Nera](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g187871-d3575232-Reviews-Pecoranera-Verona_Province_of_Verona_Veneto.html) a bit out of the city center

## What to do in the city

* Verona’s Arena: everyone will tell you that, but visiting the square is nice. Going insite could also be cool
* Visit Castel San pietro: it’s the castle on top of the city, you have a nice view of the city from there. There is either a staircase or a funicolare that takes you there for 2euros per person (if it’s hot, I would recommend)
* Visit Castelvecchio, the old castle in the city and go over the bridge, it’s one of the most suggestive views in the city
* Visit Ponte Pietra, the old bridge
