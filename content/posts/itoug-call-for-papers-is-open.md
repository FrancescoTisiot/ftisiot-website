I'm pleased to announce that, for the first time, a BI/Analytics track will be present at ITOUG!

ITOUG, the recently created Italian Oracle User Group, has been so far almost 100% DBA orientated. At the next event, which will be held on 8th June 2017 at UNA Century Hotel in Milan, we are opening a new BI/Analytics streams and looking for speakers.

Call for papers is already open, visit http://www.itoug.it for more informations. We are looking at Italian and English speakers with passion about BI/Analytics and stories to share.
