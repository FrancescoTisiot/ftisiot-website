Sometimes when defining an Apache FlinkÂ® table using SQL we need to map an [epoch timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) and use it as record/message timestamp, this blog contains few tricks to get it right.

Doing it properly is not complex, but some attention needs to be paid since small changes can have huge impact (ask me how I know... lost a good hour on it today).

## The ``TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ`` function

When dealing with epoch timestamps, Flink offers the ``TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ`` function, with a good set of [documentation](https://nightlies.apache.org/flink/flink-docs-master/docs/dev/table/timezone/) around it. Basically the function can be used with epoch timestamps in either seconds or milliseconds.

* For epoch timestamp in **seconds** use: ``TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(timestamp_column, 0)``
* For epoch timestamp in **milliseconds** use: ``TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(timestamp_column, 3)``

## What about the ``timestamp_column`` definition?

Ok, ok, that works! What about the definition of the ``timestamp_column``? You need to pay attention to it as well!

If the epoch timestamps in **seconds** you can get away with it by declaring the column as `INT`.
But if you do the same when dealing with epoch timestamps in **milliseconds** you'll face an error like 

```
Caused by: java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "1661760207278"
```

This is because the number is greater than the `INT` range (`-2,147,483,648` to `2,147,483,647`). Therefore is better to have the column declared as `BIGINT`, like the following 

```
ts BIGINT,
name string,
ts_ltz AS TO_TIMESTAMP_LTZ(ts, 3),
WATERMARK FOR ts_ltz AS ts_ltz - INTERVAL '10' SECOND
```
