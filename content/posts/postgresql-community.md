I started following the [#PGSQLPhriday](https://www.softwareandbooz.com/pgsql-phriday-001-invite/) initiative a couple months back but never had the time to properly sit down and write due to conference traveling. Therefore I was super happy to be at home this week and find out that [PGSQL Phriday #003 theme](https://sqlasylum.wordpress.com/2022/11/29/pgsql-phriday-003-what-is-the-community-to-you/) is about the PostgreSQL community!

## What is the PostgreSQL? 

I'm fairly new to the PostgreSQL community having started my journey only in 2021 but I can already point out several "benefits" of this club:

* It's **Welcoming and supportive**: like PostgreSQL itself, its community is very open to new members and very welcoming. Even for new people coming from the dark side (aka proprietary software), the community is there making space for you and helping as much as needed.
* It's **Open to new ideas**: suggestions are welcome to improve the tool and the community. Recently I was asked by a senior member about tips to make PGConf EU better, there's a continuous willingness to improve!
* It's **Open to other technologies**: my first ever IRL talk at PG Nordics 2022 was about using PostgreSQL and Apache Kafka together. There's the willingness to explore how PostgreSQL can work with the wider set of data tools out there
* It's **secure and inclusive**: the PG community is creating a very inclusive environment where every voice is heard. Security (and transparency) is also a top priority, with properly defined code of conducts and teams making sure that the rules are followed. 

So, it's a club... but it's open to everyone, welcoming, inclusive and secure!

## Experience the PostgreSQL community

The community can be seen across different "channels":

* **PostgreSQL developer community**: the great minds behind the development of the tool and the great documentation, browse the [mailing lists](https://www.postgresql.org/list/) to keep yourself informed.
* **Conferences**: where you can finally meet and talk with people known from Twitter/Linkedin/Mastodon. It has been a pleasure to attend virtually and IRL to several of them in the last two years.
* **Social platforms**: You can find lot of the PostgreSQL community on various [social media](https://postgresql.life/social/)
* **StackOverflow**: Got a question? Ask it on [StackOverflow and tag PostgreSQL](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/postgresql)


There's literally a different method for every need!

## How to get into the community?

Start from wherever you want! 
* Do you have a problem? write in StackOverflow/Mailing list/Slack/Telegram
* Do you have experience? help others across mediums
* Do you have anything to share? Write a blog, prepare a talk!

And here is **my way of giving back to the community**: I like to write and talk myself, but, even more, I want to help other voices be heard! Are you looking for a second pair of eyes on your PostgreSQL blog or abstract for a call for paper? Message me and I'll be more than happy to share my experience with you!
