Oracle Analytics Server is out since several months and a common ask is to provide SSO with Kerberos Authentication.

Oracle provided a solution to implement it via Apache Server and Oracle Access Manager Identity Asserter. All the info are published in **[Doc ID 2707401.1](https://support.oracle.com/epmos/faces/DocumentDisplay?id=2707401.1)**
